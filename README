SemanticEditTime

== About ==
Semantic EditTime is an extension to MediaWiki that works in conjunction with another extension, Semantic MediaWiki, to provide the ability to querry "Revision time" and "Revision user" properties.


== Credits ==
Semantic Tasks was written by Steren Giannini for CreativeCommons.


== Installation ==
 With SemanticMedia Wiki 1.2 : 

(1) Extract the archive to obtain the directory "SemanticEditTime"
    that contains all relevant files. Copy this directory (or
    extract/download it) to "[wikipath]/extensions/".

(2) Insert the following line into the file "[wikipath]/LocalSettings.php":
      require_once( "$IP/extensions/SemanticTasks/SemanticEditTime.php" );

(3) Add the following lines to the file /extensions/SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Hooks.php at line 37 :
        global $setIP, $setRevisionInfo;
        if ( $setRevisionInfo ) ) {include($setIP . "/SET_AddEditTime.php");}

(4) Declare the Property "Revision time" as a date property :
        In your wiki, go to page /Property:Revision_time
        and add the text [[has type::date]]


== Example of use == 
You can now use revision time and revision user to sort querries : 

{{#ask: [[Category:Task]][[Revision time::+]]
 | sort=Revision time
 | order=descending
 | limit=3
}}


== Known limitations ==
The factbox will display the Revision Time and Revision User info for every page. Add SemanticMediaWiki has a know bug which displays factboxes in places it is not supposed to be.

You can remove the factbox display :
    in the file SemanticMediaWiki/includes/SMW_Settings.php
    comment $smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_NONEMPTY;
    and uncomment $smwgShowFactbox = SMW_FACTBOX_HIDDEN;
